%description
kc is a generic non-JVM producer and consumer for Apache Kafka 0.8,
think of it as a netcat for Kafka.

In producer mode kc reads messages from stdin, delimited with a
configurable delimeter (-d, defaults to newline), and produces them to the
provided Kafka cluster (-b), topic and partition (-p).

In consumer mode kc reads messages from a topic and partition and prints
them to stdout using the configured message delimiter.

kc also features a Metadata list  mode to display the current state
of the Kafka cluster and its topics and partitions.

kc is fast and lightweight; statically linked it is no more than 150Kb.
